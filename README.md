🧪 Lab Build – How I Created the Chaos (On Purpose 😌)
1️⃣ Create Windows 11 VM named Tylesha11STIGTest
- Disabled Windows Firewall
- Opened NSG completely (all inbound allowed)
- Tested connectivity: ping <VM Public IP>

2️⃣ Intentionally misconfigured system
- Enabled Administrator account
- Set blank password, disabled expiration
- Added Administrator to Administrators group
- Enabled Guest account, added to Administrators group
- Set no password for Guest

3️⃣ Configure Tenable Scan
- Created Advanced Network Scan template
- Basic: Start Remote Registry, Admin Shares, Server service
- Discovery: Ping host, Fast network discovery, TCP port scan
- Assessment: Perform thorough tests, unchecked “only use credentials”
- Compliance: DISA Windows 11 STIG v2r5, enabled policy & plugin checks

4️⃣ Launch Scan
- Save template, create new scan, enter target IP
- Launch scan and observe results

5️⃣ Analyze Results
- Reviewed vulnerabilities by plugin, audits, remediations, severity
- Deleted lab environment afterward

🛠️ Remediation Plan – Ninja Patch Mode 🥷🏽💎
- Patch Outlook, Teams, Notepad
- Update Defender signatures
- Enable CertPaddingCheck mitigation
- Replace self-signed SSL certificate
- Re-scan and validate

🧠 Final Thoughts – Cyber Zen 🧘🏽‍♀️
- No Critical vulnerabilities detected ✅
- Notepad attempting command injection? Personal. 😏

Security is not hype.
It’s consistency.
It’s patience.
It’s ninja-level vigilance. 🥷🏽💎
